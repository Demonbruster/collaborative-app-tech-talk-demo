    A[React + TypeScript] --> D[Frontend]
    B[Tailwind CSS] --> D
    C[WebSocket] --> D
    D --> E[PouchDB]
    E --> F[CouchDB]
    F --> G[Multi-Tenant System]
```

---

# Why This Stack?

| Technology | Benefits |
|------------|----------|
| React + TS | Type safety, Component reuse |
| PouchDB    | Offline-first, Real-time sync |
| Tailwind   | Rapid UI development |
| WebSocket  | Real-time updates |

---

# Data Model
## Board Structure
```typescript
interface Board {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdBy: string;
  collaborators: string[];
  isPublic: boolean;
  accessType: 'owned' | 'shared' | 'public' | 'private';
}
```

---

# Real-Time Sync Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User1
    participant PouchDB
    participant CouchDB
    participant User2
    
    User1->>PouchDB: Update Drawing
    PouchDB->>CouchDB: Sync Changes
    CouchDB->>User2: Real-time Update
```

# Multi-Tenant Architecture
## Security First Approach

- 🔐 Tenant Isolation
- 🚦 Access Control
- 🔑 Authentication
- 📝 Audit Trails

---

# Access Control Matrix

| Action | Private | Shared | Public |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| View | Owner | Collaborators | Everyone |
| Edit | Owner | Collaborators | None |
| Share | Owner | None | N/A |
| Delete | Owner | None | None |

# Performance Optimizations

## Client-Side
- ⚡ Efficient Shape Rendering
- 🎯 Cursor Movement
- 📊 State Management

## Server-Side
- 📝 Query Optimization
- 💾 Data Indexing
- 🔄 Sync Strategies

---

# Advanced Features Demo
## Sharing System

```typescript
// URL-based sharing example
const shareURL = `${baseURL}/board/${boardId}?access=${token}`;
```

---

# Real-Time Drawing Tools
![Tools Screenshot Placeholder](tools-screenshot.png)

- ✏️ Vector Drawing
- 🎨 Color Picker
- ↩️ Undo/Redo
- 👥 User Presence

---

# Technical Challenges

## Sync Conflicts
```typescript
// Conflict Resolution Strategy
const resolveConflict = async (doc) => {
  const winner = await determineWinner(doc._conflicts);
  return winner;
};
```

---

# UX Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Latency | Optimistic Updates |
| Offline Mode | Local-First Data |
| Collaboration | Real-time Indicators |
| Performance | Progressive Loading |
